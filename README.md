# CS-230

The Gaming Room wished to take thier android application, Draw It or Lose It, and create a web-based version of it. I believe my best efforts were in the recommendations and the reasoning for them. The best advantage of working through the design document is the fact that it helped me explore all of the possibilities rather than just starting with no plan in mind. The biggest improvement I could make is my evaluation of MacOS systems. I am not very familiar with them and relied heavily on assistance rather than my own understanding. The user's needs were well attended to with the solution to optimization as many users may not have the most powerful hardware. Considering the user's needs is the most important thing as if the program doesn't meet the user's needs then they simply will not use it and all work will go to waste.
